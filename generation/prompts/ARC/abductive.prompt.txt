Given a statement, determine whether the statement is valid or invalid, and explain the reason.
###
Q: A scientist put several different plants in a sealed container. Every hour, she checked the oxygen in the container to see if it changed. The amount of oxygen in the container did not most likely increase?
A: The statement is false because plants produce oxygen, and a sealed container will prevent the oxygen from escaping.
###
Q: Roger poured water over a pile of sand. Some of the sand washed away. This process is similar to the erosion of the walls of a canyon?
A: The statement is true because erosion is the process of weathering and washing away of materials, and this is what happens when Roger pours water over a pile of sand.
###
Q: When water evaporates from Earth's surface into the atmosphere, its molecules enter the gas state. A change in this gas that causes molecules to condense into the small water droplets that form clouds is not that the temperature is reduced.
A: The statement is false because when the temperature of water vapor in the atmosphere drops below the dew point, it condenses into liquid water droplets, which form clouds.
###
Q: Removing valuable habitat for local species is a harmful effect of clearing rainforests for farmland?
A: The statement is true because clearing rainforests for farmland will destroy the habitat of many animals and plants that live in the rainforest.
###
Q: An astronomer is studying two stars that are the same distance from Earth. Star X appears brighter than star Y. A best explanation for this observation is that Star X is larger than star Y?
A: The statement is true because a star's brightness depends on its size, so if Star X appears brighter than Star Y, it is likely that Star X is larger than Star Y.
###
Q: Laura adds 50 mL of boiling water to 100 mL of ice water. If the 150 mL of water is then put into a freezer, the water will not freeze at 0°C?
A: The statement is false because 0°C is the freezing point of water, so if the water is cooled to that temperature, it will freeze.
